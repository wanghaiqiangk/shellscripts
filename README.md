# Shell Scripts

Here I put shell scripts that I have been ever using for

- as learning cases for some specific commands or tools
- as basic facilities that can be reused by other scripts

## In a Nutshell

- learning cases
  - [jq](./learning/example_jq.sh)

- facilities
  - [logging](./logging)

## Examples

Inside the root directory, there are some scripts prefixed with *example*, which are useful to give you an instant impression of how they work.

- `example_logging.sh` - Output messages both to screen and file (*test.log* in the current directory).
